## About me

I'm a rising senior from *Umass Amherst* majors in ~~CoMpuTeR SciEnCe~~. I'm 21 years young and actively looking for a full time job. I'm diligent but easy going, enjoy the outdoor
and love to travel. I'm a **GAMER** at heart which makes myself a tryhard at everything I do. I always strive for the best outcome disregarding the circumstances nor conditions.
I hope to build valuable companionship along with gaining useful experiences.
