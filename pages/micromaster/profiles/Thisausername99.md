# Introduction

I'm *Cody Hoang* from Vietnam. My current time zone is Indochina Time and the current OS that I'm using mainly is window 10.

I'm a rising senior from Umass Amherst majors in Computer Science. I'm 21 years young and actively looking for a full time job. I'm diligent but easy going, enjoy the outdoor
and love to travel. I'm a **gamer** at heart which makes myself a tryhard at everything I do. I always strive for the best outcome disregarding the circumstances or conditions.
I hope to build valuable companionship along with gaining useful experience. This is my [personal website] (https://personal-site-ea6a8.web.app/) and [Linkedln] (https://www.linkedin.com/in/huy-hoang-cody/).

Happy coding!
